												// DBT_CONFIGCHANGECANCELD, a request to change the current configuration has been canceled.
												// DBT_CONFIGCHANGED, the current configuration has changed, due to a dock or undock.
												// DBT_CUSTOMEVENT,	DBT_USERDEFINED,	DBT_QEURYCHANGECONFIG.
												// DBT_DEVICEARRIVAL, a dive or piece of media has been inserted and is now available.
												// DBT_DEVICEQUERYREMOVE, permission is requested for removal. Can be denied, thus cancel the removal.
												// DBT_DEVICEQUERYREMOVEFAILED,	DBT_DEVICEREMOVECOMPLETE,	DBT_DEVICEREMOVEPENDING,	DBT_DEVICETYPESPECIFIC.
												// DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED, a device has been added or removed from the system.
												// lParam is a pointer to a structure that contains the event-specific data. Return TRUE to grant the request, BROADCAST_QUERY_DENY to deny the request.

				CopyData = WM_COPYDATA, // The application should send this msg to pass data to another application. wParam==hWndReveiver. lParam==pCOPYDATASTRUCTURE, which contains the data to be passed. Return TRUE to indicate successful receiving, otherwise FALSE. When passing, the data being passed shall not be modified. The pointer used by lParam shall be considered read-only by the receiving window.

				Character = WM_CHAR, // Posted to the window with key focus when a WM_KEYDOWN msg is translated by the TranslateMessage function. wParam==character code of the key. lParam is shouwn in the following table:
									// bits0-15: the repeat count for the current msg, being the result of the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated when the user holds the key. If it is held long enough, multiple msg will be sent. Yet this count doesn't cumulate.
									// bits16-23: the scan code, depending on the OEM.
									// bits24: indicates whether the key is an extended key(1), or not(0).
									// bits25-28 is reserved.
									// bits29: if ALT is down(1) or not(0).
									// bits30: the previous key state. If down(1) or not(0).
									// bits31: the transition state, if the key is being released(1) or not(0).
									// It uses UTF-16.
									// WM_UNICHAR is similar, except that it uses UTF-32.

				DeadCharacter = WM_DEADCHAR, // Posted to the window with the keyboard focus when a WM_KEYUP msg is translated by the TranslateMessage function. It specifies a character code generated by a dead key, which is a key that generates a character that is combined with another to form a composite character. wParam and lParam is the same as that of WM_CHAR's.

				HotKeyPressed = WM_HOTKEY, // Posted when the user presses a hot key registered by RegisterHotKey. The msg is placed at the top of the thread's msg queue. wParam==hotKeyID. If system generated, it is either IDHOT_SNAPDESKTOP or IDHOT_SNAPWINDOW. LOWORD(lParam)==keyToBePressedInCombinationWith HIWORD(lParam) == MOD_ALT || MOD_CONTROL || MOD_SHIFT || MOD_WIN.

				KeyDown = WM_KEYDOWN, // Posted to the window with keyboard focus when a non system key is pressed. i.e. when ALT is not pressed (along with it). wParam indicates the virtual key code, in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx .  lParam is shown in the following table:
										// bits0-15: the repeat count for the current msg, being the result of the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated when the user holds the key. If it is held long enough, multiple msg will be sent. Yet this count doesn't cumulate.
										// bits16-23: the scan code, depending on the OEM.
										// bits24: indicates whether the key is an extended key(1), or not(0).
										// bits25-28 is reserved.
										// bits29: if ALT is down(1) or not(0).
										// bits30: the previous key state. If down(1) or not(0).
										// bits31: the transition state, if the key is being released(1) or not(0).

				KeyUp = WM_KEYUP,  // Posted to the window with keyboard focus when a non system key is released. i.e. when ALT is not pressed (along with it). wParam indicates the virtual key code, in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx .  lParam is shown in the following table:
									// bits0-15: the repeat count for the current msg, being the result of the number of times the keystroke is autorepeated when the user holds the key. If it is held long enough, multiple msg will be sent. Yet this count doesn't cumulate.

									// bits25-28 is reserved.
									// bits29: if ALT is down(1) or not(0).
									// bits30: the previous key state. If down(1) or not(0).
									// bits31: the transition state, if the key is being released(1) or not(0).

				KeyboardFocusLost = WM_KILLFOCUS, // Sent immediately before the window loses the keyboard focus. wParam == hWndNewFocus, which can be NULL.

				KeyboardFocusGained = WM_SETFOCUS, // Sent to a window after it has gained the keyboard focus. wParam == hWndOldFocus, which can be NULL.
