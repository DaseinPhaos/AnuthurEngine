# AnuthurEngine
## Introduction
This is an in-build realtime renderer/engine for personal study use, written in C++. Currently I've only finished the basic math part. This engine is built and tested under Visual Studio 2015.

## Acknowledgement
I should thank Eric Lengyel for his great book, *Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics*. The math part is written based on knowledges learned from this great book.
