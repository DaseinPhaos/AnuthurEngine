# AnuthurEngine
## Introduction
This is an in-building real-time renderer/game engine for personal study use, written in C++. Currently I've only finished the basic math part. This engine is built and tested under Visual Studio 2015.

## Acknowledgement
I should thank Eric Lengyel for his great book, [*Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics*](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Programming-Computer-Graphics-Third/dp/1435458869/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457356917&sr=8-1&keywords=Mathematics+for+3D+Game+Programming+and+Computer+Graphics). The math part of this engine is written based on knowledges learned from this book.

The engine also contains source code from Jason Zink's [Hieroglyph3](https://hieroglyph3.codeplex.com/), for performance tests. Source files from Hieoglyph3 is named with a "G" prefix.
